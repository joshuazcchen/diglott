## User Stories
**Team:** We would like to implement a secure system for logins so that users can save their books, API keys, page number, and just general progress. This will enable users to be able to save key words which they have already learned, without it interfering with other people potentially using the same device. 

**Mustafa:** As a Persian that doesn’t know Persian, I would love another an indirect way to learn a language while simultaneously enjoying a good read. However, reading a language with a different script can feel less natural when reading non-Latin (non-Roman) scripts, so I need to be able to read the text in the Latin (Roman) alphabet.

**Joshua:** As a profound Duolingo user (I maxed out Duolingo Chinese, French and German), I would love an alternative way to learn languages without risking my life with a green bird. I would like to be able to translate between non-english languages so as to improve both my reading in existing languages, as well as learn a new language simultaneously.

**Roy:** As a reader and student, I want to be able to upload a .txt, .pdf, or .epub file so I can learn using material that actually interests me. I don’t always connect with pre-selected content, so being able to use my own files makes the experience feel more personal and motivating. Plus, if I already know the story, I can focus more on the new vocabulary without getting lost in the plot.

**Nehan:** As someone who learns best through listening, Nehan wants to hear the translated words read aloud while reading the story. Being able to hear proper pronunciation helps reinforce vocabulary and makes it easier to remember new words. This would make the experience feel more immersive and engaging, especially when learning unfamiliar languages through context. Having this feature built right into the reading flow keeps learning smooth and enjoyable. 

## Accessibility
Although our Google TTS could help blind people in theory (if given assistance), the program is not entirely Blind-friendly. The program also isn't Deaf-friendly when it comes to our Google TTS feature. It also isn't accessible for anyone who wishes to learn a language that isn't included in DeepL or Azure. Use at your own discretion.
